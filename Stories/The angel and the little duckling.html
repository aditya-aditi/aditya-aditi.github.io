    <h5>
      <p>Once upon a time, there lived a duck. She has laid five eggs some time before. She was worried about an egg
        that was very different from other eggs, it was big than the other four eggs. The outer shell was beautiful of
        that big egg than the others. Duck thought that the ducking that will hatch from the bigger egg will be most
        beautiful. One day the four eggs hatched but the fifth one, that was the bigger egg didn’t hatched. From the four
        eggs little and beautiful ducklings came out. Duck thought that the fifth egg was big and beautiful so
        it will take time to hatch, so she sat on the egg and started to give warm to it.</p>
      <p>One day the fifth egg also hatched but from it an ugly duckling came out. Duck thought “He is ugly from his
        body but I will make him beautiful from mind and heart.” Then from that day she taught every duckling good
        habits but no one listen her except the third, fourth and the ugly duckling. Seeing the good habits of the ugly
        duckling she named her Gooddu. Gooddu became very beautiful from mind and heart. Then one day duck thought to
        name the four ducklings so she named them. She named the first one Baddu, second one Habbu, third one Sina and
        the fourth Mina. Sina, Mina and Gooddu play together and live together while Baddu and Habbu always tease Goodu.
        All ducks and drakes tease Goodu except her mother, Sina and Mina.</p>
      <p>One day an angel tried to test the goodness of the ducks and drakes. So she became a fish and lied on the
        ground next to the river. She cried for help. Many ducks and drakes went from that way but no one helped the
        angel. All the ducklings and the duck were at home when the Gooddu said that he want to go out and roam then
        Sina and Mina jumped and said “We will also go with Gooddu”. Goodu said “No my sisters, I want to roam alone”.
        Sina and Mina agreed with Gooddu and not went with Gooddu.</p>
      <p> Gooddu went out of the home and saw the angle in a form of fish and helped her. He hold the fish in his mouth
        and put her in the river. Then the angel came in its real form and said to Gooddu “Gooddu you are very good. You
        are very beautiful.” Hearing this he became happy for a while and then became sad. Angel asked “Why are you
        became sad?” “I am sad because you said that I am beautiful. You are the first one who have appreciated me and
        teased me like this. All said that I am ugly and tease me. I felt bad but today you have teased me by saying
        that I am beautiful. It hurt me.” Gooddu said. Angel “Oh Gooddu! I have not teased you, I have said truth.”
        Gooddu “No I am not beautiful.” “It’s wrong. See yourself in the water” Angel said and immediately she changed
        Gooddu in a beautiful duckling. When Gooddu saw himself in the water he was shocked. He was very beautiful. He
        asked the angel that how he became so beautiful the angel answered “Who are beautiful from mind and heart they
        are also beautiful from body.” But the duckling can’t understand anything. Suddenly a strong wind blew and the
        angel disappeared.</p>
      <p>Gooddu happily went home and asked the meaning of the sentence that angle answered in the question of Gooddu.
        The duck explained the meaning of the sentence and from then on nobody teased Gooddu. And the best thing was
        that Baddu and Habbu were now good ducklings.</p>
